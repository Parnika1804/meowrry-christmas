🎄😺 Meowry Christmas

Meowry Christmas is a fun, Christmas-themed mini game where Santa is tired, kittens are picky, and gifting goes hilariously wrong.
The goal isn’t to win — it’s to laugh, fail, and enjoy the chaos.

🎮 What is the Game?

Gifts are hidden in a playful Christmas environment

Players must find gifts and match them to the right kitten

Each kitten has a strong personality and reacts with funny acceptance or refusal reasons

Wrong choices trigger sass, animations, and chaos instead of punishment

✨ Why This Project?

To show that games don’t need complexity — they need personality

To celebrate creativity, vibe coding, and joyful failure

🎁 Final Note

it’s about gifting wrong, getting judged by kittens, and loving every second of it.

Fail. Laugh. Meowry Christmas. 🎄😺
